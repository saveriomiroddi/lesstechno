# "Less technical" blog

This is the repository for my ["less technical blog"](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io/lesstechno), which deals with computing, but not with the depth of my [professional blog](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io) repository.

Note that his repository has two separate licenses:

- [BLOG_ENGINE_LICENSE](/BLOG_ENGINE_LICENSE): for the blogging engine project (forked from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now));
- [POSTS_LICENSE](/POSTS_LICENSE): for the posts I write.
